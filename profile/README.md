## DecarbonX by Angara Global

DecarbonX is the decarbonization program for the Global Petroleum Industry.

The program consists of several stages to decarbonize the Industry.
The AI-development is the main of them.

DecarbonX may become an essential part of your Digital transformation program!
We generate a massive amount of the fouling analysis data which is connected to the fluid properties and operational data.
The fouling analysis contains information about the building up of anomalies in processes and integrity risks.
This data is the missing part of the efficiency and decarbonization puzzle.
